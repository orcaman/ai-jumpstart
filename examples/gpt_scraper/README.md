# GPT Python Scraper

This Python scraper is designed to extract specific information from an HTML string, using OpenAI's GPT models. The scraper can extract Location, Asset Class, Year Built, Units and JPG Image from the provided HTML content.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI Python library (`openai`)
- python-dotenv library (`python-dotenv`)

## Installation

1. Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Usage

You can directly run the script by:

```bash
python scraper.py
```

The script currently works with hardcoded data, which is a list of messages. Each message in the list is a dictionary that has two keys: `role` and `content`. The role can be 'system' or 'user', and content is the actual text of the message.

The 'system' message defines the information that needs to be extracted from the HTML content. The 'user' message contains the HTML content itself.

To use your own HTML content, modify the 'user' message content in the `main` section of `scraper.py`.

```python
m = [{
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Extract the Location, Asset Class, Year Built, Units and JPG Image from the HTML page ..."
    }, {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "<div class=\"property-detail\"> ..."
}]
```

## Functionality

The `get_chat_completion` function uses the OpenAI ChatCompletion API to generate a chat completion. It takes a list of messages as input and returns a chat completion, which is a response generated by the GPT model.

## Troubleshooting

If the OpenAI API call fails, the function will raise an exception. Ensure you have correctly set your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file and your key has the necessary permissions.
